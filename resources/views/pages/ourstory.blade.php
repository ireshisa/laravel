                Let us tell you the story how we came up with the idea and what we are planning to solve at Search Jobs Global.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ran a recruitment firm earlier and identified that many startups find it difficult to find a suitable candidate for their business vacant positions. What the companies want is to recruit staff easily at an affordable rate without wasting time but what happens is they pay a huge sum of money to post a job post or for candidates and they get valueless and very limited number of applicants. Most of them don’t even attend the interviews after applying for the job post and end up wasting valuable time of the management. Also, the management don’t have time to check CVs one by one and call the candidates to arrange interviews or to check the quality of the CVs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Search Jobs Global, we understand this problem. We have been in this industry for 5+ years serving 150+ companies. We had this problem and found that most of the startup companies have this problem as well. Therefore, we decided to solve this issue by creating Search Jobs Global.
                In Search Jobs Global, we make the job posting and employee head hunting free of charge. We will only charge you if both parties are agreed and connected provided that they attend interviews only. We have review system in place to check the quality of the candidate. You can schedule interviews through the website itself with just one click but if you need to call them as well, we can do that for you at a small charge while you focus on growing your business by focusing on key areas. With us, recruiting candidates for startups have been made easy, cost effective and hassle free.
